# Research Extensions

## Metrics
- False positive rate (single-sensor vs correlated)
- Mean time to detect (sensor → incident)
- Confidence score calibration
- Baseline noise modeling per location
- Analyst workflow timing

## Statistical / ML
- Z-score / EWMA for anomaly baselining
- Isolation Forest / One-Class SVM (unsupervised)
- LSTM (time-series) once labeled data exists
